# Contributing to the Africa Internet Measurements Project

Thank you once again for your interest in joining this project! üëèüèæ üéä üéâ

The [Broadband Performance and Internet Measurements project](https://github.com/MsKiden/africa-internet-measurements) aims to build a portal and work with researchers to collect and analyse Internet measurements data so that regulators and policy makers can develop policy that will help Internet Service Providers to improve service delivery and end users to make informed choices. Please see more information in the project [README.md](https://github.com/MsKiden/africa-internet-measurements/blob/master/README.md). 

This document ([CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/MsKiden/africa-internet-measurements/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)) is a set of guidelines for contributing to the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/MsKiden/africa-internet-measurements).

## Participant guidelines
Please take a look at the project [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MsKiden/africa-internet-measurements/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which outlines our expectations for participants within the project. 

## What we are working on



We are proposing to build an open data platform that contains Internet performance information and some analysis from the last 5 years (at least). This portal will contain information like number of subscribers (fixed, mobile), costs of Internet packages, coverage maps for 2G, 3G, 4G and fibre, some quality of service analysis in terms of graphs and charts, etc. We also plan to collect any papers written about the subject and add them as resources. The portal will be publically available.
